           compliance and compatibility. A web application is created

           Using this application, the test cases are run in web browsers
           and the test results are stored in a database. The results
           are correlated with the market share of the used web browsers
           and their degree of vendor support. Thus, features can be
           defined as safe for use in web browsers, which makes
           efficiency-reducing compatibility measures unnecessary.”<?php

      <p>Many people talk about <strong>JavaScript</strong> as if
         it was one fully specified and universally implemented
         programming language.  But it is in fact only the name of
         one implementation of a standard for an extensible
         programming language, <strong>ECMAScript</strong>, which
         is enjoying <em>several implementations</em> that are
         widely distributed.</p>
         
      <p>This standard – the ECMAScript Language Specification –
         is published in Editions.  While several current versions
         of programming languages are implementations of ECMAScript,
         the first Edition of ECMAScript was based on two programming
         languages that were already implemented for use in Web browsers:
         Netscape JavaScript 1.1 and Microsoft JScript 1.0.</p>
                  
      <p>Superficially, ECMAScript implementations are very similar.
         It is therefore tempting to discuss them in a simplified way
         using an umbrella term.  Often that term is “JavaScript” or,
         supposedly in order to avoid misunderstandings, variations
         in letter case thereof, such as “Javascript” and “javascript”
         (the latter term is currently used in the
         <a href="http://jibbering.com/faq/">comp.lang.javascript FAQ</a>).</p>
         
      <p>Although this approach is common, it is not without problems.
         ECMAScript gives its conforming implementations a wide latitude.
         The Editions of ECMAScript and their implementations
         have been developed in parallel, and are partially
         informing each other.  Also, some implementations are not
         conforming in some features.  As a result, ECMAScript
         implementations are in fact very different from one another.</p>
         
      <p>Hence, it does matter which implementation is being discussed.
         Using ambiguous umbrella terms such as the ones mentioned,
         without providing a clear definition for them, cannot be
         considered appropriate style in a technical discussion.</p>
